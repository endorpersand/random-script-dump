# Script Dump

Hi! Welcome to the script dump!
This repo consists of a scrambled mess of scripts that I just happened to have.

The initial commit has them in their untouched form, but as the repo updates, there'll be modifications to some of the scripts to make them easier to use.

Good luck figuring out what these do!

Highlights:

* [Multivector.py](/Multivector.py): Very simple implementation of Geometric Algebra / Clifford Algebra
* [vietrandsylls.ts](/vietrandsylls.ts): Random generation of Vietnamese-like syllables
* [balance.py](/balance.py): Chemical equation balancer
* [sumofpowers.py](/sumofpowers.py): Calculator for the sum 1^k + 2^k + ... + n^k
