# Cursed TypeScript

Welcome to the cursed TypeScript zone!

This folder contains absolute horrors of TypeScript scripts that run functions in compile-time.

- `derivative.ts`: Compile-time polynomial parser and derivative calculator
- `fizzbuzz.ts`: Compile-time FizzBuzz
- `bit.ts`: Bitwise operators... with types. Byte addition and multiplication too, heh.
